Some of the scripts I use for flux balance analysis of genome scale models. All of the scripts are based on using the excellent [COBRA toolbox][cobra] for Matlab. Feel free to fork and modify any of these as you will. The scripts I use mainly focus on estimating the sensitivity of the model to small changes in parameters. For example estimating the sensitivity of growth to small changes in amino acid requirements.
